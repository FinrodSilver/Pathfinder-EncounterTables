Pathfinder Random Encounter Tables

First program that I wrote for the Java Language, written in swing and based off the Pathfinder PRD.
Simplistic and easy to use, allows the user to roll random encounters from the wandering monster tables located
on the Pathfinder PRD website at http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/encounterTables.html
